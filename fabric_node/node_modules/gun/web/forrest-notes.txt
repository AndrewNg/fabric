NOTES FROM FORREST:

-3. `gun.path('players').path(id).set({x:0, y:0});` doesn't trigger `gun.path('players').on()`
-2. gun.on() needs to be chainable with map and stuff.
-1. Maybe make the map module core to gun?

 1 make raw HTTP work and document it (DONE), document that attach needs to be BEFORE listen. (talk to AJ)
 2 make sure you SUPPRESS your comments, Mark. (DONE)
 3 .get doesn't work on subsequent closures. WHYYY??
 4 HOW DO I DELETE? Mark: delete the actual field from the data, but not the stream/meta.
 5 security ideas: have gun KEY regexs that are whitelist/blacklist. Off the keys.
 6 Forrest says, "arrays". (LISTS!)
 7 get VAL without gun meta-data.
 8 make it work with just Gun('/gun');
